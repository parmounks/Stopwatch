# Stopwatch App

This is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides basic functionalities such as starting, stopping, resetting, and recording laps.

## Project Structure

### 1. HTML (index.html)

The HTML file defines the structure of the stopwatch app, including the display area, 4 control buttons (Start, Stop, Lap, Reset), and a list to display recorded laps.

### 2. CSS (watch.css)

The CSS file contains styles for the app, creating a visually appealing and responsive design. It sets the background color, font styles, and layout for the stopwatch elements.

### 3. JavaScript (watch.js)

JavaScript handles the logic behind the stopwatch functionalities. It uses intervals to update the display, records laps, and manages the start, stop, and reset actions.

## How to Use

1. Open `watch.html`, `watch.css` and `watch.js` files at the same time in a code editor and hit live preview.
2. The stopwatch initially displays "00:00:00."
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch. The button will change to "Pause."
4. Click "Pause" to stop the stopwatch temporarily. The button will change to "Resume."
5. Click "Reset" to reset the stopwatch to zero.
6. While the stopwatch is running, click "Lap" to record a lap time. The recorded laps will be displayed below the stopwatch.
